# Bibliothekai

Bibliothekai's mission is to provide a comprehensive resource on the best translations of classical texts into modern languages. We want to help students, teachers, and interested readers everywhere access Greek and Roman literature, history, and philosophy through accurate, accessible, and up-to-date translations into English and other modern languages.

Bibliothekai is an open source application build with Python, Django, and the Lightning Web Components framework. Bibliothekai is (c) 2021 by David Reed and is licensed under the BSD License.
